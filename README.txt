Character is a derivative of brainfuck, in which the characters don't matter, but the length of the code does.

The compilers are slightly badly written, just replace the variable "input" to what you want

I really don't know if it's possible to make a quine out of this, since a code that prints "0" (without the ""'s, of course) is 16560192985941429687810947002060866170024727391877882451339296979209212508326978794894101778075517908357350457162849244043756542625097790959554255893016708705942769602305019932522137097528090247358475003695442544753354978230005242268 characters, and bytes long. 

It's VERY VERY ineffician, since a 6 character brainfuck code compiles into a 15436447 character character code.
